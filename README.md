# Markdown Previewer

This is the second project for the *Front End Development Libraries Certification* provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

I chose to complete it using ReactJS and have published the gh-pages branch of this repository on [GitHub Pages](https://benberryallwood.github.io/markdown-previewer).
This is one of the projects I have chosen to include on [my portfolio site](https://benberryallwood.github.io).

## freeCodeCamp

freeCodeCamp offer many free online certifications, with a vast amount of resources to learn from as well as very regular articles.
Incidentally, I would also highly recommend Quincy Larson's mailing list; he sends five links to articles, videos or similar each week which are very interesting and useful (to me at least).

## About This Project

Here are the [details about the aims](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) of this project.
The course that this project is part of covers:

- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- SASS
- React
- Redux
- React and Redux together.

Of these, I decided that React would be most suitable because of the requirement of the live preview and the state-handling abilities of React.

I used the tool [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to get up and running quickly and focus on the functionality.
The default CSS is very basic, but for this project very little extra was needed.
As a result, I went for vanilla CSS rather than SASS.

As suggested by freeCodeCamp, I used the [Marked library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked) to parse the Markdown.

My final note is that [line 32 of public/index.html](https://github.com/benberryallwood/markdown-previewer/blob/97afe778834e1a56fb5fcbc1b01506e1f31de85f/public/index.html#L32) contains the freeCodeCamp testing script.
My project has passed the tests included and it is now commented out for aesthetic reasons.
